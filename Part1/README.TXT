COMP309 Assignment 4 Part 1 Read me
This folder contains the data, python script and output for my part 1 analysis.

Do not alter the structure of the files within this folder.
To run it, simply load part1.py into whatever IDE you use and click run. 
It should find the data file by itself.
Note that I have commented out the line of code in the file which draws the graph as it opens a separate window.
If you wish to see the graphs, simply uncomment this line.

No known bugs.
